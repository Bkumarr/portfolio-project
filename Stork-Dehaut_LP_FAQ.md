**[What type of development environment is required ?]**

The only pre-requisite is Python 3.8. An Anaconda distribution (incl. Jupyter notebook) and conda for managing the libraries is recommended. Nevertheless, the liveProject has been tested on Google CoLab, Azure Machine Learning and on-premise using Visual Studio Code.

The training and testing phases require extensive processing. The use of GPU is strongly recommended.
